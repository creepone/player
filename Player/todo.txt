set mime types to the query so that only audio files are loaded

use Documents subpath for the file location (to be able to use both debug and release versions)
a screen with "an error occured" into the Cloud Import view
get rid of the warning (deprecated AudioSessionAddPropertyListener)

show some progress while importing the songs (takes quite a long time for many songs)
bigger tap area for the download icon

long term:
refactor the "Activity View" to use MVVM
introduce some service container mechanism so that the VMs can be unit tested

app store release todos:
activate dropbox app for public
