think about the signals usage in the PLActivityView(Controller) again, also maybe refactor to MVVM ?

think about the relationship between table view delegates (e.g. PLPlaylistsSongsDelegate) and MVVM - where do they fit into the picture ?

implement reordering of the tracks on the main screen (+ Edit button that triggers it)

long term:
refactor all the promise usages to RAC, remove dependency on RXPromise and its extensions
