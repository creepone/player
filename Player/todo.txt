refactor PLTrackTableViewCellController to viewmodel pattern
refactor PLActivityViewController to signals

think about the relationship between table view delegates (e.g. PLPlaylistsSongsDelegate) and MVVM - where do they fit into the picture ?

implement reordering of the tracks on the main screen (+ Edit button that triggers it)

long term:
refactor all the promise usages to RAC, remove dependency on RXPromise and its extensions
